# React ArcGIS Identity OAuth Basic

This project is a React version of the sample code demonstrated [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/identity-oauth-basic/) in official ArcGIS tutorial. It uses OAuth2 to authenticate with ArcGIS Online and then uses the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to display the user's portal items.
